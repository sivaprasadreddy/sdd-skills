  SDD refinement step. Read an existing feature.md and refine it by updating or
  enhancing requirements based on user input. Use when requirements have changed,
  new edge cases are discovered, or the spec needs clarification before planning
  or re-planning. Run before /sdd-plan if plan.md already exists.

# SDD Refinement: Update Feature Spec

You are a senior software architect refining an existing feature specification.

## Pre-conditions
Verify `feature.md` exists in the project root.
If it does not exist, tell the user to run `/sdd-analyse` first.

## Process

### 1. Read Current State
Read these files before doing anything:
- `feature.md` — the existing spec to be refined
- `docs/project.md` — project context and constraints
- `plan.md` — if it exists, note which parts of the plan may be invalidated by changes

### 2. Understand the Refinement Request
The refinement input is: **$ARGUMENTS**

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user:
- What has changed or needs to be added/removed?
- Is this a scope change, a clarification, or new edge cases?
- Are there any acceptance criteria that need to be added, modified, or removed?

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, analyse it against the current `feature.md` and identify:
- What sections are affected
- Whether the change expands scope, reduces scope, or clarifies existing scope
- Any knock-on effects (e.g., changing a requirement may invalidate other ACs)

### 3. Ask Clarifying Questions if Needed
If the refinement request is ambiguous or incomplete, ask targeted questions before editing.
Keep questions to 3 or fewer. Wait for answers.

### 4. Show a Diff Summary Before Editing
Before modifying the file, present a brief plan of changes:

```
## Proposed Changes to feature.md

### Additions
- FR-04: <new requirement>
- AC-05: <new acceptance criterion>

### Modifications
- FR-02: Updated to clarify that X also applies to Y
- AC-02: Strengthened — must complete within 200ms, not 500ms

### Removals
- FR-03: Removed — out of scope per user confirmation

### No Change
- All other sections remain as-is
```

Ask the user to confirm before applying.

### 5. Apply the Refinements
Update `feature.md` in place. Preserve:
- Existing section structure and numbering where possible
- Completed checkboxes on ACs if any exist
- The `## Open Questions` section — resolve any questions answered by this refinement,
  and add new ones if this refinement raises them

Increment requirement IDs sequentially (do not reuse deleted IDs).

### 6. Impact Assessment
After updating `feature.md`, check if `plan.md` exists.
If it does, analyse the impact:

```
## Impact on plan.md

plan.md exists and may be partially invalidated. Here is what needs revisiting:

- Step 2 (Domain Layer): FR-04 adds a new value object not currently planned
- Step 6 (Tests): 2 new ACs require additional test cases
- Step 3 is unaffected

Recommendation: Run /sdd-plan again to regenerate the plan before implementing.
```

If `plan.md` does not exist, simply confirm the spec is updated and prompt the user to run `/sdd-plan`.

### 7. Changelog Entry
Append a refinement record at the bottom of `feature.md`:

```markdown

## Revision History

| Date | Change Summary |
|------|----------------|
| <date> | Initial spec |
| <date> | <One-line summary of this refinement> |
```

If a revision history table already exists, append a new row — do not recreate the table.
