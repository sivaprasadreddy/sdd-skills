  SDD step 7. Archive feature.md and plan.md into docs/specs-archive/<yyyymmddHHMM>-<feature-name>/ directory,
  then update docs/project.md with the new feature, and any architecture decisions made. 
  Use after /sdd-review is complete and the feature is ready to merge.

# SDD: Archive

## Inputs

| Input          | Required | Description                                                                      | Example              |
|----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| `feature_name` | Optional | Archive folder name in kebab-case. Derived from `feature.md` heading if omitted. | `jwt-authentication` |

## Steps

### Step 0: Validate Inputs (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST)

Check the conversation for `feature_name` and for `feature.md` / `plan.md` in the project root.

- If `feature.md` or `plan.md` do not exist → stop and tell the user both files are required.
- Note whether `impl-summary.md` exists in the project root — it will be archived if present.
- If `feature_name` is provided → use it as the archive directory name (kebab-case).
- If `feature_name` is missing → read `feature.md` and derive it from the `# Feature:` heading,
  converting to kebab-case (e.g. "User Authentication" → `user-authentication`). Proceed automatically.

---

## Process

### 1. Determine the Feature Name
Use `feature_name` from Step 0. Capture the current timestamp using `date +"%Y%m%d%H%M"` and prepend it to form the archive directory name: `<yyyymmddHHMM>-<feature-name>` (e.g. `202604191430-jwt-authentication`).

### 2. Verify Completion
Read `feature.md` and check that all acceptance criteria checkboxes are ticked.
If any are unchecked, warn the user and ask for confirmation before archiving.

### 3. Update docs/project.md

This is a critical step. Read `docs/project.md` in full, then read the archived
`feature.md` and `plan.md` to extract what actually changed. Update `project.md`
across the following sections — add sections if they do not already exist.

#### 3a. Features List
Locate or create a `## Features` section. Add the new feature as a single line entry:

```markdown
## Features
- **<Feature Name>**: <one-sentence description of what it does> (`docs/<feature-name>/`)
```

Preserve the existing list. Append the new entry — do not reorder or remove existing entries.

#### 3b. Architecture Decisions
Scan `feature.md` (Open Questions, Technical Scope) and `plan.md` (Architecture Decisions)
for any decisions that represent a meaningful change or addition to how the system is built.

Examples of what qualifies:
- A new architectural pattern introduced (e.g., added an event-driven flow, introduced CQRS for a module)
- A cross-cutting decision that will affect future features (e.g., "all auth tokens use RS256 signing")
- A deliberate deviation from existing conventions, with rationale
- A new integration point with an external system

Examples of what does NOT qualify:
- Routine implementation choices that follow existing conventions
- File naming or package placement decisions
- Minor refactors that don't change architectural direction

For qualifying decisions, locate or create an `## Architecture Decisions` section:

```markdown
## Architecture Decisions

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Feature |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| <date> | <what was decided> | <why> | [<Feature Name>](docs/<feature-name>/) |
```

If the table already exists, append a new row. Do not recreate the table.

#### 3c. API Surface (if applicable)
If the feature added or changed REST endpoints, locate or create an `## API` section
and document the new endpoints:

```markdown
## API
| Method | Path | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | /api/v1/auth/login | Authenticate user, returns JWT | No |
| POST | /api/v1/auth/refresh | Refresh access token | Yes (refresh token) |
```

Only add endpoints that are new or changed. Preserve existing entries.

#### 3d. Environment / Configuration
If the feature introduced new environment variables, configuration keys, or
`application.properties`/`application.yml` entries, add them to an
`## Environment & Configuration` section:

```markdown
## Environment & Configuration
| Key | Description | Required | Default |
|-----|-------------|----------|---------|
| JWT_SECRET | Secret key for JWT signing | Yes | — |
| JWT_EXPIRY_MINUTES | Access token TTL in minutes | No | 15 |
```

### 4. Show the project.md Changes
Before writing, present a summary of every change you are about to make to `project.md`:

```
## Proposed project.md Updates

### Features (1 addition)
- Added: JWT Authentication

### Architecture Decisions (1 addition)
- Added: All tokens signed with RS256; public key distributed via /.well-known/jwks.json

### API (2 additions)
- Added: POST /api/v1/auth/login
- Added: POST /api/v1/auth/refresh

### Environment & Configuration (2 additions)
- Added: JWT_SECRET
- Added: JWT_EXPIRY_MINUTES

### No changes to
- Tech Stack, Architecture overview, Conventions
```

Ask the user to confirm before writing. If they request changes to the proposed
updates, apply their corrections first, then write.

### 5. Archive
Run the following operations:
```bash
ARCHIVE_DIR="docs/specs-archive/$(date +"%Y%m%d%H%M")-<feature-name>"
mkdir -p "$ARCHIVE_DIR"
mv feature.md "$ARCHIVE_DIR/feature.md"
mv plan.md "$ARCHIVE_DIR/plan.md"
# move impl-summary.md only if it exists
[ -f impl-summary.md ] && mv impl-summary.md "$ARCHIVE_DIR/impl-summary.md"
```

### 6. Create a Brief Summary
Create `docs/specs-archive/<yyyymmddHHMM>-<feature-name>/README.md`:

```markdown
# <Feature Name>

Implemented on: <date>

<Brief description of what was built, key files, and any notable decisions.>
```

### 7. Confirm
Report the final summary to the user:
- Files archived to `docs/specs-archive/<yyyymmddHHMM>-<feature-name>/` (`feature.md`, `plan.md`, and `impl-summary.md` if it existed)
- Sections updated in `docs/project.md`
- Remind them to commit both `docs/specs-archive/<yyyymmddHHMM>-<feature-name>/` and `docs/project.md` to version control
